This was a project for a subject called "Network management"

This project This project consists of develop a software that make one pc able to manage the running processes of other pc's.
We used SNMP protocol to let the pc manager get the running processes of the managed pc's

This project only works on windows beacuse it use a MIB of windows systems.
You will have to enable snmp on your PC's to run it.
